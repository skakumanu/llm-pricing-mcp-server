# Design Principles

This project aligns with AGNTCY.org design principles to ensure clarity, sustainability, and impact in all aspects of development and user interactions. Below are the key principles we follow:

1. **Clarity**: Ensure that all elements (code, UI, documentation) are straightforward and easy to understand.
    - Code should be clean, well-commented, and follow Python and FastAPI best practices.
    - Documentation must provide clear instructions for contributors, operators, and users.

2. **Sustainability**: Focus on long-term maintenance and adaptability.
    - Use modular code architecture for scalability and flexibility.
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines to enforce testing, linting, and security scans before changes are deployed.

3. **Impact**: Build meaningful tools that provide value to users and stakeholders.
    - Make pricing calculations for LLMs transparent, accurate, and useful.
    - Leverage Pydantic models to ensure the reliability of computations and validations.
    - Implement APIs to directly address user needs (e.g., `/pricing` aggregating data from multiple providers).


By adhering to these principles, we aim to create a robust, user-centric MCP server that benefits all stakeholders.
